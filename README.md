Task 1: Set Up Basic Firewall Rules On Ubuntu
Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) on Ubuntu to manage network access. UFW provides an easy-to-use interface for managing firewall settings. Begin by enabling UFW with the command sudo ufw enable. You can set up rules to allow or block specific applications or ports by using commands like sudo ufw allow [port/application] or sudo ufw deny [port/application]. This ensures better control over inbound and outbound traffic.



Task 2: Use a Password Manager Install and configure a password manager like Bitwarden on Ubuntu. Use the Ubuntu Software Center or install via Terminal by running sudo snap install bitwarden. This allows you to securely store and manage all your passwords. You can also use the password manager to generate strong, unique passwords for each account, reducing the risk of security breaches.



Task 3: Identify Phishing Emails Learn to identify phishing attempts by reviewing common signs, such as suspicious links, requests for urgent actions, or unfamiliar email addresses. In Ubuntu, you can manage your emails using a secure client like Thunderbird, which includes phishing protection. Pay attention to red flags like poorly formatted emails or mismatched domains. Make sure to report any phishing attempts through the appropriate channels or by marking them as spam.
